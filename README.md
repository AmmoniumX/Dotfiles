A collection of personal linux dotfiles, comes with an `install.sh` script.

The following programs are recommended to be installed on the system:
- eza
- bat
- fzf
- starship prompt

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmmoniumX/Dotfiles.git && cd ./Dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Then, restart your shell or source the appropriate file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
