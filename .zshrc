# 1. Home and End Keys (Go to beginning/end of line)
# These are often bound to ^[[H and ^[[F respectively, but can vary by terminal.
# The standard functions are beginning-of-line and end-of-line.
# Try these first (common for many terminals):
bindkey '\e[H' beginning-of-line
bindkey '\e[F' end-of-line

# 2. Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right (Word navigation)
# These are often bound to ^[[1;5D and ^[[1;5C respectively, but can vary.
# The standard functions are backward-word and forward-word.
# Try these first (common for many terminals):
bindkey '\e[1;5D' backward-word  # Ctrl-Left
bindkey '\e[1;5C' forward-word   # Ctrl-Right
